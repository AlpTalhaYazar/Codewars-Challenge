# Codewars Challenge

This repository, maintained by AlpTalhaYazar, is dedicated to solving challenges from Codewars. The solutions are written in C#.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of two main directories:

1. `Codewars-Challenge-Tests`: This directory contains unit tests for the challenges, ensuring that the solutions work as expected.
2. `Codewars-Challenges`: This directory contains the actual solutions for the challenges.

## Challenges Solved

1. **Hamming Number Challenge**: A method for this challenge has been written and corresponding unit tests have been implemented. The solution can be found in `HammingNumber.cs`.

2. **Parse Int Reloaded Challenge**: The challenge involves creating a function to parse a string and convert it into an integer. The solution is in `ParseIntReloaded.cs`.

3. **Weird String Case Challenge**: This challenge involves creating a function to convert a string to "Weird Case", where each word in a string should start with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters, and this pattern should repeat for every character in a word. The solution is in `WeirdStringCase.cs`.

4. **Who Likes It Challenge**: This challenge requires the creation of a function that formats a string based on an input array of names. The function needs to return who likes the post, similar to the system used on social media platforms. The solution is provided in `WhoLikesIt.cs`.
